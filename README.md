# codeinplace2020
Code in Place 2020 was a 5-week introductory online Python programming course based on material from the first half of Stanford Universityâ€™s introductory programming course, CS106A.

It was offered online by Stanford during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020), with 10,000 global students and 900 volunteer teachers participating from around the world.
  
For my Code in Place final project, I created a program that makes a triptych from an original image. Users can pick an image of their choice and turn it into a triptych.
