# codeinplace2020
  - Code in Place 2020 was a 5-week introductory online Python programming course based on material from the first half of Stanfordâ€™s introductory programming course, CS106A.
  - It was offered online by Stanford University during COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020), with 10,000 global students and 900 volunteer teachers participating from around the world.
  
For my Code in Place final project, I created a program that makes a triptych from an original image. Users can pick an image of their choice and turn it into a triptych.

Here is my final project: https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/public/projects/1455.html
